This project allows Warframe players to check the value of their relics based
on the upgrade tier, which allows players to determine which relics should be
upgraded.

Using this should be quite straightforward. Simply clone the repository and run
`cargo run` (or `cargo run --release`). This will initialize the relic table.
Note that to enter a relic, you need to use "correct" capitalization, i.e.
'Lith' and not 'lith', and 'A1' and 'a1'.

Any questions and issues should be reported to this repository.
